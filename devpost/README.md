3. Clone this repo, and change directory into this folder.
3. After the file has finished processing, right-click `Download report` and save the file as `submissions.csv` in this folder.

### 2. Using the CLI tool

The tool will have outputted `categories.csv` and `projects.csv`, both of which can be imported directly to Gavel.
